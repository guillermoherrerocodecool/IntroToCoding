# Intro To Coding | Breaking News

This is a solo challenge. So you're supposed to solve it on your own. You can ask others for some guidance, though. Like mentors or other peers.

Here are some hard facts:
- Read the description in the Challenge - Solo PDF document.
- Use CodeSandbox as your development environment for conveniency without the need of installing anything else in your computer: https://codesandbox.io/
- The challenge has three parts/tasks. Make sure you complete one before jumping into the next.
- Use the code in this repository as the starting point of the challenge and work on it. You can download the files and upload them to CodeSandbox. You can also copy-paste their contents as well.
- Have fun playing around with HTML and CSS! :)
